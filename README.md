# The Count of Monte Cristo Dataset Share 

## Dataset Source:
For this dataset share I found an open text file for one of my favorite books, The Count of Monte Cristo. This file was compiled by The Project Gutenberg E-text. 

## Dataset Description: 
This .txt file includes the entirety of the novel from title page to last page note made by the Gutenberg Project. 

## Descriptive Statistics:
Tokens: 150,506
Unique Tokens: 12,905
Average Token Length: 5.99984
Lexical Diversity: 0.08574
Top 10 Tokens: 
1.	said (3,111)
2.	one (1,493)
3.	would (1,179)
4.	monte (1,125)
5.	de (1,033)
6.	man (792)
7.	young (783)
8.	two (738)
9.	replied (709)
10.	count (688)

## Interesting Questions:
-	How does this book compare in descriptive stats in comparison to other Dumas books?
-	What characters have the most lexical diversity? Who speaks the most?

## Next Steps:
To continue analysis, I would create a word cloud using pandas of the top 50 words used throughout the book. I would also find another Dumas books with an open .txt file and run the same analysis and then compare the statistics. Is older work less diverse than newer work?
